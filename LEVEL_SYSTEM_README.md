# Temple Run Clone - 3-Level System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive 3-level system with different graphics, mechanics, and character data for each level, plus proper state management for level transitions.

## System Architecture

### 1. LevelConfig Class (`levels/LevelConfig.java`)
Defines configuration for each level including:
- **Graphics Assets**: Background, player, enemy, bullet, and power-up image paths
- **Gameplay Mechanics**: Player speed, bullet speed/damage, enemy spawn rate/speed/health
- **Level Progression**: Score requirements, max enemies, available power-ups
- **Visual Effects**: Background color, particle effects, music and sound paths

#### Level Configurations:

**Level 1 - Forest Temple**
- Theme: Ancient forest temple
- Difficulty: Easy
- Enemy Health: 1, Speed: 150f, Max Enemies: 3
- Available Power-ups: health, speed, shield
- Background: Dark forest green (#2E5D31)

**Level 2 - Desert Ruins**
- Theme: Scorching desert ruins  
- Difficulty: Medium
- Enemy Health: 2, Speed: 200f, Max Enemies: 5
- Available Power-ups: health, speed, shield, multishot, rapidfire
- Background: Sandy brown (#D2691E)
- Special weapons enabled

**Level 3 - Ice Cavern**
- Theme: Frozen ice cavern
- Difficulty: Hard
- Enemy Health: 3, Speed: 250f, Max Enemies: 7
- Available Power-ups: health, speed, shield, multishot, rapidfire, laser, freeze
- Background: Sky blue (#87CEEB)
- Special weapons enabled

### 2. LevelManager Class (`levels/LevelManager.java`)
Manages level progression, transitions, and state persistence:

#### Key Features:
- **Level Progression**: Automatic advancement based on score thresholds
- **State Persistence**: Saves and restores player health, speed between levels
- **Smooth Transitions**: 2-second fade transition with level name display
- **Manager Integration**: Configures EnemyManager and PowerUpManager for each level

#### Player State Persistence:
- Health and max health preserved
- Movement speed maintained
- Position reset to level start point

### 3. ResourceManager Updates
Enhanced to support level-specific assets:
- `loadLevelResources()`: Loads assets based on LevelConfig
- Dynamic asset creation with level-specific colors and themes
- Proper cleanup of previous level resources
- Fallback to placeholder assets if files not found

### 4. Enhanced Managers

#### EnemyManager Updates:
- `configureLevelSettings()`: Sets spawn rate, speed, health, max enemies
- Level-specific enemy spawning logic
- Uses level-appropriate enemy graphics

#### PowerUpManager Updates:
- `configureLevelSettings()`: Sets spawn rate and available power-ups
- Level-restricted power-up spawning
- Added HEALTH power-up type for instant healing

### 5. GameEngine Integration
Updated to orchestrate the level system:
- Level transition detection and handling
- Player state restoration after transitions
- Level-specific bullet configuration
- Transition effect rendering

## Asset Paths (Placeholder)
Current implementation uses placeholder paths that can be replaced with actual assets:

- Player: res/drawable/level1_forest_player.png
- Enemy: res/drawable/level1_forest_enemy.png
- Bullet: res/drawable/level1_magic_arrow.png
- Power-up: res/drawable/level1_forest_powerup.png

Level 2 (Desert):
- Background: res/drawable/level2_desert_background.png
- Player: res/drawable/level2_desert_player.png
- Enemy: res/drawable/level2_desert_enemy.png
- Bullet: res/drawable/level2_fire_bullet.png
- Power-up: res/drawable/level2_desert_powerup.png

Level 3 (Ice):
- Background: res/drawable/level3_ice_background.png
- Player: res/drawable/level3_ice_player.png
- Enemy: res/drawable/level3_ice_enemy.png
- Bullet: res/drawable/level3_ice_shard.png
- Power-up: res/drawable/level3_ice_powerup.png
```

## Level Progression Logic
- **Level 1**: Score 0-149 points
- **Level 2**: Score 150-299 points (advance at 150 points)
- **Level 3**: Score 300+ points (advance at 300 points)
- **Victory**: Complete all 3 levels

## Transition Effects
- 2-second fade transition between levels
- Level name and number displayed during transition
- Game objects hidden during transition
- Smooth visual continuity

## Testing Features
- Build successful with no compilation errors
- All managers properly configured for level-specific behavior
- Player state persistence working
- Transition system integrated

## Usage
The system automatically progresses through levels based on score. Players maintain their health and abilities between levels while facing increasingly difficult challenges with different visual themes and mechanics.

## Future Enhancements
- Add actual asset files to replace placeholders
- Implement level-specific music and sound effects
- Add more sophisticated transition effects
- Expand to support more than 3 levels
- Add level selection menu
